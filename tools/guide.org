* Startup

Everything starts  with generating 16x16  tiles. You  are welcome to  start with
128x128 tiles if you find it easier,  but you'll have to control well your tiles
so they don't add up much. Remember  that VRAM is limited on the PlayStation, so
your art  is going to have  to be cut into  8x8 pieces, and these  pieces should
fill a 256x256 texture at max, at the end of these steps, and shouldn't have too
many colors, so let's say you're constrained to 1023 tiles of 8x8 pixels (tile 0
is always a blank tile).

Your first  step is  creating a  16x16.png file  with your  16x16 tiles.  If you
started working with 128x128 you could probably cut them up into a single sprite
sheet with the aid of Aseprite.


** Generating Python's virtualenv

This is how  you can create a  virtualenv with all Python pendencies  to run the
tools, though you won't really need it in most cases, since there are no "weird"
packages being used:

#+begin_src bash
cd tools/
python -m venv ./venv
./venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
#+end_src

To   run   any   scripts    with   this   venv,   run   ~./tools/venv/bin/python
./tools/script.py~.

* Generating 8x8 tiles and their 16x16 mappings

The following  steps will  allow you to  create intermediate  files 'tiles.png',
'map16.json' and 'collision16.json'.

You will  also be able  to cook these  files into PlayStation-only  engine files
'TILES.TIM', 'MAP16.MAP'  and 'MAP16.COL'. These  are binary equivalents  to the
files above, with only relevant information.

Extra files such as 'tiles16.tsx' will also be generated.

 1. Create '16x16.png' tiles.
 2. Import '16x16.png' tiles into a 'tiles16.tsx'.
 3. Export 'tiles16.tsx' from Tiled as 'collision16.json'.
 4. Copy '16x16.png' to '8x8.png'.
 5. Open '8x8.png' (still 16x16 tiles) on Aseprite.
 6.  File >  Import >  Import Sprite  Sheet. The  single image  will be  used as
    one. Make it a 16x16 grid.
 7. Right click layer > Convert to > tilemap. Make it a 8x8 grid.
 8.  File  >  Scripts  >  export_tilemap_psx.  This  will  create  a  '8x8.json'
    file. Rename it to 'map16.json'.
 9. File  > Scripts >  export_tileset_psx. Use a  8x8 grid. This  will overwrite
    '8x8.png'. Rename it to 'tiles.png'.
10.  Open  'tiles.png'  with  your  favorite  editor  and  make  sure  that  all
    transparent pixels are set to color `#000000` (black).
11. Use TIMTOOL.EXE (preferably) from Psy-Q  library to generate a .TIM for your
    tiles. This  will generate a 'TILES.TIM'  file on the same  directory of the
    texture.
    - Make  sure you  un-mark the  "Set for  Black" option  in Semi  Transparent
      Information.
    - Make sure your tileset is at 448x0  and that the CLUT information is 4-bit
      depth and at  320x257.  Notice that texture  pages 8 and 24  are for level
      tiles and CLUT information, respectively.
    - *NOTE:* If you use another tool such  as TIMEDIT, just make sure the black
      color   is  accurately   picked  as   transparent  color,   and  that   no
      semi-transparency is  enabled. Also ensure  the positions for  the texture
      and the CLUT on proper texture pages.
12. Use the tool 'framepacker.py' to turn 'map16.json' into a 'MAP16.MAP' file:\
    ~framepacker.py --tilemap map16.json MAP16.MAP~
13.  Use  the   tool  'cookcollision.py'  to  turn   'collision16.json'  into  a
    'MAP16.COL' file:\
    ~cookcollision.py collision16.json MAP16.COL~



* Generating 128x128 tiles and mappings

The  following steps  will allow  you  to generate  a 'MAP128.MAP'  file from  a
'tilemap128.tmx'.
This 'tilemap128.tmx'  tile is supposed  to be a  map comprised of  16x16 tiles,
created from the same '16x16.png' file we addressed earlier.
Each 128x128 tile is  supposed to be equivalent to every  eight rows and columns
on the .tmx map.

Please make  sure that  the first  tile is  COMPLETELY BLANK  and mind  the tile
sequence (tiles are counted first from left to right, then up to down).

1. Create a 'tiles16.tsx' map from '16x16.png', if you haven't already.
2. Create  a 'tilemap128.tmx' map and  use 'tiles16.tsx' as tileset.  This map
   must have infinite dimensions.
3. Create your tiles from left to right, and if you must, up to down. Be mindful
   of  tile order,  and make  sure that  the first  tile (first  eight rows  and
   columns) are completely blank.
4.  Once  you're done  with  your  map (you  may  save  your project  for  later
   manipulation), export your .tmx to a 'map128.csv'.
5. Use the tool 'chunkgen.py' to turn 'map128.csv' into a 'MAP128.MAP' file:\
   ~chunkgen.py map128.csv MAP128.MAP~

** Preparation for level map creation

Do this in preparation for creating your actual level map:

1. Go back to your 'map128.tmx' and export it to an image called '128.png'.
   - Make  sure you  didn't mess  up  the tile  mapping,  and that  the tile  is
     properly aligned with the upper left  corner of your frame. You'll see that
     by looking at the continuous line in your 128x128 infinite map.
   - Make sure you  didn't mess up the map size  also. Generally speaking, extra
     tiles on the right side are just as  bad; use Map > Resize Map as needed to
     ensure that there are no extra tiles to the right.
2. Create a '128x128.tsx' tileset and use image '128x128.png' as base.
   - If  you already  created this  file, once  you re-export  '128x128.png', it
     should update with no extra effort needed, and so will your level maps that
     use this tileset.


* Generating your level

The following  steps will allow  you to create level  maps such as  'Z1.tmx' and
'Z2.tmx',  and generate  levels such  as 'Z1.LVL'  and 'Z1.LVL',  in PlayStation
format.

This   will   also  create   intermediate   files   such  as   'Z1.psxlvl'   and
'Z2.psxlvl'.  This intermediate  representation  is necessary  because Tiled  is
unable  to  export  levels  in  binary  format  in  one  go,  due  to  scripting
limitations.

You'll need to have  Python scripting enabled in Tiled, and  you'll also need to
have `lvlexporter.py` on  your Tiled scripts directory  (generally `~/.tiled` on
Linux).

1. Create a 'Z1.tmx' or 'Z2.tmx'  file using '128x128.tsx' as tileset. The level
   must be exacly 255x31 blocks long; block size must be 128x128.
2. Create  a layer called  'LAYER0' and another  one called 'LAYER1'.  Make sure
   that 'LAYER1'  is above 'LAYER0';  level layers  are exported from  bottom to
   top.
3. Draw  your tiles preferably on  'LAYER0' (this part is  still unfinished, but
   this is  the only layer where  collision detection happens). Use  'LAYER1' to
   draw tiles  that should go on  front of your  character (this part is  also a
   work-in-progress).
4.  Once you're  done  with  your map,  go  to File  >  Export  as..., pick  the
   "PlayStation proto map" format, and save it as 'Z1.psxlvl' or 'Z2.psxlvl'.
5. Use  the tool 'cooklvl.py'  to turn 'Z1.json'  or 'Z2.json' into  'Z1.LVL' or
   'Z2.LVL':\
   ~cooklvl.py Z1.psxlvl Z1.LVL~
